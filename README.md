# CMP NeoPixel Sign

This was a basic circuit playground express project thrown together to make a quick sign for 5th grade walkthroughs.
I basically wrapped a long strip of neopixels around a block of wood and then mapped out the visible grid.
I then wrote a program to have it print CMP, clear the screen. Draw and arrow, convert the arrow to a "pac man like" area and had a yellow pixel eat some stuff before clearing the screen.
